View my full process of this project on my portfolio website: [Here](https://hoangphipv.id.vn/project3.html)

Welcome to the **Customer Segmentation Project**! In this project, I delve into the world of data analysis to uncover insights about customer segments using **RFM Analysis** and apply **K-Means Clustering** for further segmentation.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on:

- **RFM Analysis:** Utilizing the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) framework to gain insights into customer behavior and segment customers based on their interactions with the business.

- **K-Means Clustering:** Applying the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers with similar attributes into distinct segments, providing deeper understanding and tailored strategies.

## Technologies and Tools

Throughout the project, I will leverage:

- **RFM Analysis:** Utilizing SQL or similar tools for data analysis.

- **K-Means Clustering:** Implementing the K-Means algorithm using Python and relevant libraries.

- **Visualization:** Creating informative visualizations using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

- **Insights Presentation:** Summarizing my findings and insights.

Let's embark on this journey to uncover valuable customer insights and enhance decision-making through effective segmentation techniques!
